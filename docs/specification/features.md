# Features

WHAT CAN A USER DO:
Like, rate, and review TV shows, down to each episode.

## Core Features

### Interacting with Stuff
A user can like, rate, and review an episode, season, or the entirety of a TV show itself.

> This would all be prompted at once.

A user can choose when they have watched an episode.

A user can choose when they have started and finished a show.

> We could apply this to seasons.

All of this can be changed at any time.

### A User's Profile

A user's profile would contain:
- A photo
- Username
- *X* number of favorite TV shows
- Recent activity
- Ratings
- A graph that shows where all the reviews of a user fall

The profile will also have a list of what they have liked and any lists they have created.

> The formatting of the list may be confusing and complicated.

#### Logging

A user will also be able to track the total number of episodes they have watched. They will also be able to see how many episodes they have watched and are watching in the current year.

The user can also see a timeline of what shows they watched each year, separated by years and then into months. Selecting a year will bring up the months of that year. Selecting a month will bring up a calendar that dates an episode has been watched. If there is no date where nothing was watched, it will not be brought up.

> We could also log the "number of shows watched" using this system.

### Lists

Lists are a collection of episodes, TV shows, and seasons. Lists are NOT type-locked except for liked lists, see below.

A user can create their own lists. The list will require:
- A name
    > If a name is not given, the list would default to something like "username's list 1," "username's list 2," etc.
- The user has the option to create a description for the list.
- The user also has the option to create a description for each entry in the list.
    > This allows the more hardcore TV enthusiasts to really spill their thoughts and give a deep analysis.

### Interacting with Other Users

A user can like reviews left by other users, as well as add a reaction from a set of emojis.

> The set of emojis could contain smile, sad, shocked, angry. I think it creates a sense of community.

A user can look at another user's profile and see what they have liked, their reviews, and their lists.

## Features of the TV Show Object

Each screen of the show would contain:
- Its cast and crew

    > It would include the role they played or what their job was.
    
- Studio
- Synopsis
- Rating
- Number of seasons 
- Total number of episodes 
- When the show started and ended
- Tags
- A graph that shows where all the reviews fall
- Reviews

> If the show has roles that have been changed:
> 
> It would show what years they were active for.

Each show should have screenshots of scenes from the show.

The rating of the show would be based on the reviews of all the episodes in the show.

> We could also rate the show in two other ways:
>- A rating based on combining all the season ratings.
>- A rating based on a score that the user will give.
> We could also apply this to seasons.

> An example of a potential design could be a square that has seasons, likes, lists, and reviews (this would consist of reviews of the entire show).

## Features of the Season Object

The features of the season object would be a near-exact copy of the TV show object except for:
- The number of seasons
- The total number of episodes

And will feature the total number of episodes in the season object.

> A user should be able to backtrack from an episode to a season and its show. Figure out a way to make this possible.

## Features of the Episode Object

The features of the episode object would be a near-exact copy of the TV show object except for the total number of episodes.

## Home Screen
> What dictates popularity is *X* amount of interactions in a *Y* amount of hours.

### Popular Episodes/TV Shows Tab
This tab will include episodes or TV shows that are trending (have the most interactions within an arbitrary amount of time).

> If it's possible, let's try and find a way for it to contain episodes trending worldwide.

### Popular Reviews
Reviews that have gotten the most likes from across the user base.

### Lists 
Would contain lists that are popular, as in having the most interactions (likes).

## Search Capabilities PRIORITY
A user should be able to search for a cast member/crew member and find what other productions they have been a part of. It will say exactly what they did on that show and the years they did that role.

When typing and entering something in the search bar, we should get results that can be split up into 6 categories:
- Shows
- Episodes
- Studios/Companies
- Users
- Cast
- Crew (crews can be filtered down to the role, maybe)

# EXTRA
Based on user data, we could recommend shows to the users. We can even create/recommend lists for them as well (with playful names), something similar to how Spotify's recommendations work.

> However the hell that works.

1. Able to create an account for the application for users to make their own reviews.
2. In the home page, users can search for TV shows in a search bar.
3. The home screen will have the option to side-scroll through selections and row categories of show genres.
4. When entering a search, it will take the user to a results screen.
5. Users can create their own reviews and rate their own episodes.
6. Ratings will be by episodes, which will accumulate to an average that represents the season's overall rating.
7. Users will also be able to rate the show entirely on a different rating score.
